			<h3>Explaining the nuances behind reported crime data before, during, and after the pandemic</h3>

			<p>An example of underreported crime data is found in the “Bronx” column on the raw data set. From 2002 to 2014, the data category for count of firearm crimes is registered as “0”. There was no explanation on the Data Catalog website description for this dataset. Though no contact with the publisher of the dataset was made, this data, spanning 12 years, is missing and was not included for an unknown reason. Firearm crime rates are absent for Kings, New York, Richmond, and Queens counties. 

			<p>Each of these counties are located relatively central to the New York City urban sprawl compared to counties like Onondaga, Westchester, and Hamilton, for example, illustrating the way high crime levels, urban location, and high persecution combine to lead to underreporting and overreporting of crime. In areas with high crime, police are more active and punitive and more violent crimes go reported. Or, there are so many gun crimes for example that a portion go unreported due to norms and expectations in a certain area. </p>

			<p>Contrasting with the hypothesis that the pandemic lessened shootings and violent crime, Covid did not really affect life on the street, according to a gun violence prevention specialist in Syracuse. Clifford Ryan, of the organization OG’s Against Gun Violence, works specifically in a boots-on-the-ground manner, breaking up shootings and violent fights, and although he was nervous about the virus, Ryan says that “the pandemic really didn't have much of an effect on [violent crime], as far as the community was concerned… There were several times where I stopped fights during the pandemic, which in and return stopped stabbings and gun violence,” indicating that he followed protocol when possible but Ryan’s assumed duty of preventing crimes, especially among the youth, took precedent and priority during the lockdown. </p> 
			<p>Supporting Cliff Ryan’s belief that violent crime was not lessened or dissipated by COVID in the way some analysts may theorize, the reported firearm rates in New York, Bronx, Queens, and Kings counties increased in 2020 from 2018. For example, the firearm rate in the Bronx increased from 79 reported counts per 100,000 residents in 2018 to 84 in 2019, and finally booming in 2020, increasing to about 130 reported firearm crimes per 100,000 Bronx residents. In the two years following the pandemic, the rates increased. </p>

			<h3>The Reality Behind the Rates is that Crime is Increasingly Pervasive</h3>
			<p>What becomes apparent at a baseline through this data is the daily pervasiveness of violence in America. Cliff Ryan has geared his organization toward the dysfunctional nature of violence in community, meaning he aims to prevent the breakdown of routines and loss of life that accompanies this kind of crime. “Our work is geared towards the gun violence, the senseless gun violence that we face on a daily basis throughout the United States, as well as in the community,” he said in his interview, harkening to the nationwide problem that is daily violence on fellow citizens. New York, the Bronx, Kings, and Queens counties represent four of the counties with the most pervasive violent crime. All four present more than 10,000 violent crimes reported in 2022, all increasing from the prior year, too. 10,000 such crimes in a year equates to about 28 a day, meaning there are almost thirty reported—not actual—violent crimes a day in some of the most recognizable, iconic American boroughs. This statistic highlights the reason Ryan puts his body on the line to prevent violence: it happens every single day, and whether the crimes are reported or not, families ache. </p>

			<h3>How Urbanization Affected Crime Data in the Pandemic Era</h3>
			<p>Comparing an inner-city borough in New York City to a more sprawled-out county further upstate can be a valuable measure for understanding the way location and geography affect policing as well as crime itself. 
			
			<p>Onondaga County, a four-hour drive upstate from New York City and home to Syracuse, a city with 200,000 in population, reported a firearm rate of 84 per 100,000 residents in 2022, up from an average of 78 from 2020-’21. Although Syracuse is a city with relatively high crime to other upstate areas like Hamilton County, it is much more sprawled than the Bronx County, which reported 214 firearm-related crimes in 2022. With a population in the Bronx of about 1.5 million compared to less than 500,000 in Onondaga, the Bronx encompasses 42 square miles of land. The county upstate features almost 800 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Thus, the spread-out nature of the upstate counties results on paper in less reported crimes per 100,000 residents according to the dataset analyzed.</p> 

			<p>Vaia.com, a British news publication, asserts that urbanization contributes to causing crime due to the high numbers of people in which to blend, as well as due to creating poverty and poor living conditions. These are strong factors that influence crime in America, as well, as the crowds and bustle in cities can allow criminals to go unnoticed and crimes unreported. Because cities will not go out of fashion soon, it is important that legislators tackle instead the access to firearms and weaponry, as much as it is important for citizens to stand up for themselves in protest of poor social conditions and levels of violence seen in very few other countries. </p>

			<h3>Dealing with Reported Data</h3>
			<p>In order to account for under- or overreporting when viewing future datasets about reported crime statistics, be mindful about the factors that lead to this phenomenon in order to view crime data through an educated and critical eye. When examining a specific locale, pay attention to the “racial and ethnic makeup, its composition by age and gender, educational levels, and prevalent family structures”, according to the FBI, as variables that influence the way crime data is reported by different jurisdictions.

			The limitations of this dataset pertain to the nature of street crime: certain amounts of crime go underreported, especially in areas with less police funding, or different levels of law enforcement effort. The FBI asserts that the amount of reporting and persecution varies by agency depending on the jurisdiction studied: 
			
			“One city may report more crime than a comparable one, not because there is more crime, but rather because its law enforcement agency, through proactive efforts, identifies more offenses.” 
			
			In areas with high crime, police can be more active and punitive and more violent crimes go reported. Or, there are so many gun crimes for example that a portion go unreported due to norms and expectations in a certain area.
